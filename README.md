# Earthquake_Viz

## Project Overview
In this project I visualized earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) onto an interactive map.

The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.



I plotted a map with earthquake with size and color based on the magnitude of the earthquakes

I then created a legend that provides further details about each earthquake such as time, date, magnitude and the number of reports of people feeling the earthquakes.
